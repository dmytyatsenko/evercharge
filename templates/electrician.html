							<p class="black">Traditional charging options only support a small number of EV drivers. Costs to make additional power available for charging can become prohibitively expensive. SmartPower overcomes this inherent problem by intelligently managing available power to provide up to 10 times the number of chargers.</p>

							<h2>Dedicated Home Charging</h2>
							<p class="black">Convenient dedicated home charging makes the whole EV experience work. Without it, the hunt for an unoccupied public charger becomes a constant activity. By efficiently managing electrical capacity, EverCharge makes dedicated home charging possible.</p>

							<h2>Lower Installation Costs</h2>
							<p class="black">EverCharge designs infrastructure layouts to meet each of our customerâ€™s needs while leveraging our technology. Traditional charging solutions require dedicated and metered runs from the main electrical panel. EverCharge uses technology embedded in our chargers to monitor electricity usage to manage customer billing and the building reimbursement without the need for meters or submeters. </p>

						<div class="col-sm-6">
							<p class="black">SmartPower provides efficient charging for all vehicles by leveraging the fact not all vehicles charge at the same moment in time and do not constantly require maximum draw during a charging cycle. SmartPower always works to get the most vehicles charged as quickly as possible, freeing up capacity. The best way to think about SmartPower is to visualize EverCharge as one charger with many outlets.</p>
