<br>At all times and without exception, the Service Provider retains rights and privileges of title and ownership of the Charging Systems used to provide Services as found herein, and shall retain such rights and privileges upon any and all acts or events of termination of this Service Agreement. Following a voluntary termination of this agreement, the Member may claim ownership of the Charging System after payment of any applicable state and local sales tax to Service Provider, calculated from the price paid to Service Provider at execution of this agreement. Alternatively, the Service Provider may offer to "buy-back" the hardware for a fair market value.

Once installed, ownership of Electrical Infrastructure is not affected by the status of this Agreement, and a termination or suspension of this Agreement by either Party does not transfer ownership without the Service Provider’s expressed written consent.
