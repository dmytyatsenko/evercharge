		<legend><span><center>We are EverCharge</center></span></legend>

			<p>EverCharge provides the only EV charging system designed specifically for condos, apartment buildings, and parking garages. Our charging units install directly into a resident’s parking space for <strong>exclusive</strong> use.</p>

			<p>What makes us different? We offer the only <strong>fully managed</strong> and affordable solution for EV charging.  We’ve made things easy by providing insurance, maintenance, support and billing services for every customer.</p>

			<p>Plus, our <strong>Power Management Technology</strong> enables you to maximize your building’s charging potential by up to 10x, avoiding costly infrastructure upgrades and lowering installation costs.</p>

		<legend><span><center>How it Works</center></span></legend>
			<p>Our system connects to readily available common area power in the building. This enables us to get commercial electricity rates and to easily scale throughout the garage for additional users.</p>

			<p>Each unit meters the electricity consumed. We then bill the resident and fully reimburse the HOA.</p>

			<p>All members receive <strong>ID Cards</strong> that your charging unit recognizes - just tap your card and charge away.</p>

		<legend><span><center>Power Management System</center></span></legend>
			<p>EverCharge uniquely learns driver behaviors through its <strong>Power Management System</strong>. The system splits the available power and allocates it to vehicles as needed. </p>

			<p>This increases the charging capacity by up to 10x, without the need for expensive electrical upgrades.</p>
