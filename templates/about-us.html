	<h2>
		Our Patented Power Management System
	</h2>
	<p>
		EverCharge learns each driver's unique behavior through our <strong>Power Management System</strong>. The system splits available power and allocates it to vehicles as needed - ensuring every EverCharge customer gets the power they need, when they need it.	
	</p>
	<article class='col-md-16 col-xs-16'>
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>
			EverCharge’s power management technology maximizes a building’s potential by significantly increasing the number of EVs that can charge at a given site before costly infrastructure upgrades are needed. Power is intelligently managed based on the number of vehicles using the system and available power for charging. When EverCharge senses extra power is available, or that the rated capacity is reached, the system allocates power to vehicles according to their needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Power management maximizes total charging while preventing system overloads. In short, power management will maximize your building's infrastructure usage while reducing costs.
		</p>

	<article class='col-md-16 col-xs-16'>
		<h4>How the Technology works</h4>
		<p>
			EverCharge within the same garage, communicate with one another over a wireless mesh network. This network enables the system to perform real-time load balancing to ensure the system remains under the rated capacity at all times. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As a user plugs in his or her car and taps their RFID card, the system performs a series of safety checks confirming the available power among the charge group. In the event multiple chargers among a charge group are plugged which will exceed the power allocated to a charge group, the system will then redistribute the available power among vehicles.

		<p>
			<em>Power draw varies based on vehicle type and position in the battery cycle. As a battery reaches full capacity it will not accept full power from the charger, which opens up an opportunity for EverCharge to reallocate power to other vehicles.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			As a data-driven company, EverCharge analyzes building demographics and driving behaviors to advise on the number of vehicles your infrastructure can support using our system. EverCharge will never allow a building to dilute power to a level that will not provide sufficient levels of charge and performance. On average drivers only need 2-3 hours of charging per day (40-60 miles) and residents come in at varied times, offering us a wide window to fully charge vehicles.

		<h4>Power Management in Action</h4>
		<p>
			 A 100 amp panel serves a 5-car charge group. When the first car plugs in, it receives 30 amps. The same happens when the second and third cars plug in. Now 90 amps of power are being used. With a traditional charging system, no more chargers could be installed; this is where power management takes off. When the next car plugs in, the system evenly distributes the 100 amps among the vehicles providing 25 amps to four vehicles and 20 amps when five vehicles are plugged in. As vehicles reach full capacity and take on less power or complete charging, the additional power is pushed back to the remaining vehicles.
