			<article class="col-md-10 col-xs-5" style="text-align:left;">
				<p>Our system connects to readily available common area power in the building. This enables us to get commercial electricity rates and to easily scale throughout the garage for additional users.</p>

				<p>Each unit meters the electricity consumed. We then bill the resident and fully reimburse the HOA.</p>

				<p>All members receive <strong>ID Cards</strong> that your charging unit recognizes - just tap your card and charge away.</p>

			<p>EverCharge uniquely learns driver behaviors through its <strong>Power Management System</strong>. The system splits the available power and allocates it to vehicles as needed. </p>

			<p>This increases the charging capacity by up to 10x, without the need for expensive electrical upgrades.</p>
