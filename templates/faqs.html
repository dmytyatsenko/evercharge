                        <p>EVSE stands for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment and refers to any off-board equipment used to supply energy to vehicles. This can include cords, wall-, pedestal-, or pole-mounted charges, and the different outlets and plugs that make up the circuit.</p>

                        <p><strong>SAE J-1772 Connector</strong>: This is the standard plug type for EVs in the United States, and can connect directly to most EVs manufactured for the North American market after 2000. Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed this connector standard, and though not required, most vehicle manufacturers have adopted this connector type.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Tesla Connector</strong>: The Tesla connector is the standard connector for all Tesla vehicles. Tesla offers an adaptor that can be used to charge with J-1772 connector. EverCharge also offers a Tesla plug, so no adaptor is necessary.</p>

                    <div class="ec-faq-a">
                        <p>Our charging stations connect to readily available common area power in a building. This enables us to easily scale throughout the garage for additional users by consolidating conduit and wire.</p>
                        
                        <p>Using access cards, our charge stations monitor electricity consumed by residents. Monthly members are billed for the amount of energy used, and quarterly we fully reimburse the property for energy consumed by EV charging.</p>
                        
                        <p>Proprietary SmartPower technology intelligently allocates power among chargers via a wireless network. This enables us to rapidly charge more vehicles and support up to ten times as many chargers. All without costly building infrastructure upgrades or recurring costs to the HOA or building owner.</p>

                    <div class="ec-faq-a">
                        <p>Installation costs are determined by an onsite evaluation. Existing electrical infrastructure, distance from the electrical room, and complexity determine the variable installation costs.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lowering Installation Costs</strong></p>

                        <p>Installing multiple chargers at the same time can significantly decrease per-unit installation costs. In cases where a building requires infrastructure upgrades (such as a new panel or transformer), we can work with the interested residents and the HOA to distribute the costs appropriately. EverCharge is happy to assist with surveying residents to better understand the interest within the community.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since every building is different, the best way to get started is to contact EverCharge, so we can get started on the quote process today.</p>

                        <p>All EverCharge chargers are installed directly in the owner's personal parking space for their exclusive use.

                        <p>Access is granted to each charger by a personal ID card, exclusive to each customer.</p>

                        <p>We have several customers who live in buildings with valet or unassigned parking, and in these cases we work directly with the building to ensure that every resident still has 24/7, exclusive access to a charger.</p>
