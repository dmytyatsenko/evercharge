			<h2 id='evse_definition'>What is EVSE?</h2>
			EVSE stands for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment and refers to any off-board equipment used to supply energy to vehicles. This can include cords, wall-, pedestal-, or pole-mounted charges, and the different outlets and plugs that make up the circuit.

			<h2 id='charge_levels'>Levels of EV Charging</h2>
			There are considered to be three levels of charging for EVs - each pulling different amounts of power.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Level 1</strong>: Standard 110v household outlet, not generally recommended for EV charging.
					<br>
					<em>1 - 4 miles of range per hour of charging.</em>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Level 2</strong>: 208, 220, or 240v outlet, similar to an electric dryer. This level is compatible with all electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids and is the best option for charging in homes and mulit-tenant buildings.
					<br>
					<em>20 - 60 miles of range per hour of charging.</em>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Level 3 (DC Quick Charger)</strong>: An off-board charger that connects directly to a vehicle's high-voltage battery bus. This type of charging allows for high power tranfer and can charge a battery to 80% capacity in minutes, instead of hours. DC Quick Charging can cost over $100,000 to install, so generally is cost-prohibitive for residential charging.
					<br>
					<em>Up to 200 miles of range per hour of charging.</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			SAE J-1772 is the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard that covers AC Level 1 and 2 and DC Level 1 and 2 charging. J-1772 is the standard for AC charging in the United States.

		<article class='col-md-8 col-xs-5'>
			<h2 id='plugs'>Types of EV Adaptors</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>SAE J-1772 Connector</strong>: This is the standard plug type for EVs in the United States, and can connect directly to most EVs manufactured for the North American market after 2000. Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed this connector standard, and though not required, most vehicle manufacturers have adopted this connector type. It can be AC Level 1 and 2 and DC Level 1 and 2 charging.</li>
				<li><strong>Tesla Connector</strong>: The Tesla connector is the standard connector for all Tesla vehicles. Tesla offers an adaptor that can be used to charge with J-1772 connector. EverCharge also offers a Tesla plug, so no adaptor is necessary.</li>

			<h2 id='how_it_works'>How EverCharge Works</h2>
			Our charging stations connect to readily available common area power in the building. This enables us to get commercial electricity rates and to easily scale throughout the garage for additional users by consolidating conduit and wire.
			<br>
			<br>
			Using access cards, our charge stations monitor electricity consumed by residents. Monthly we bill members for the amount of energy used, and quarterly we fully reimburse the HOA for all energy consumed by EV charging. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Our proprietary power management technology intelligently allocates power among chargers via a wireless mesh network. This enables us to  quickly charge more vehicles and support up to ten times as many chargers. All without costly building infrastructure upgrades or recurring costs to the HOA or building owner.

			<h2 id='install_cost'>Cost of Installation</h2>
			Installation costs are determined by an onsite evaluation. Existing electrical infrastructure, distance from the electrical room, and complexity determine the variable installation costs.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Lowering Installation Costs</strong>
			<br>

			Installing multiple chargers at the same time can significantly decrease per-unit installation costs. In cases where a building requires infrastructure upgrades (such as a new panel or transformer), we can work with the interested residents and the HOA to distribute the costs appropriately. EverCharge is happy to assist with surveying residents to better understand the interest within the community.

			<h2 id='install_location'>Installation Location</h2>
			All EverCharge chargers are installed directly in the owner's personal parking space for their exclusive use. A building that has multiple EverCharge customers will all use the same power source, but are still able to charge directly from their own space.
			<br>
			<br>
			Access is granted to each charger by a personal ID card, exclusive to each customer.
			<br>
			<br>
			We have several customers who live in buildings with valet or unassigned parking, and in these cases we work directly with the building to ensure that every resident still has 24/7, exclusive access to a charger.

			<h2 id='permitting'>Required Permits</h2>
			Installation of EV charging in common areas of a residential or commercial building requires an electrical permit and final inspection by the city. A city permit provides a description of the installation, outline of the electrical infrastructure, account address, workers compensation declaration, and more.
			<br>
			<br>
			EverCharge handles the entire time-consuming application and inspection process for city permits.
