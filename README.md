## Deploying with the `eb cli`

Prerequisites
- AWS SSO credentials
- aws-vault and profile for prod-aio
- eb cli
- docker desktop or cli

The eb cli can be installed natively, or use the devtools `docker-compose` in the infra repo, in the tools folder.

    $ git checkout <branch>
    $ aws-vault exec <profile>
    $ cd src/infra/tools
    $ docker compose run devtools

    ðŸŸ  infra tools -> cd web
    ðŸŸ  infra tools -> eb list

    WebMain-38-env
    * Webmain-staging38-env

    ðŸŸ  infra tools -> eb deploy

## URLs

- prod: https://evercharge.com (Webmain-38-env)
- staging: https://web.staging.evercharge.com (Webmain-staging38-env)

## Load balancer listeners

**Listeners for port 443 are created manually** so that prod and staging can use distinct certs via ACM. This is done using the ElasticBeanstalk environment configuration in the Load Balancer section.

The production-only .net to .com redirect is also done manually, using the Load Balancer Listener Rules page:

HTTP to HTTPS redirection is still done for both envs in `.ebextensions/alb-http-to-https-redirection.config`.

NOTE: This is a temporary solution as a stop gap until we can redeploy this with Pulumi using EB in the account based envs. Both staging and prod are deployed to the prod-aio account as of 2022-09-12.

# Run locally

## Docker Compose Quick Start

> Note: Support for arm64, amd64, and x64 architectures are currently built in. If the output of `dpkg --print-architecture` (in the running container) does not emit one of those three strings, you will need to either symlink your string to an existing binary, or download a new binary. See the Dockerfile and the dart-sass folder for the template.

0. (docker rm web)
1. docker compose build
1. docker compose up
1. Point a browser at http://localhost:9000

## In Detail

### Docker Commands

Build the container:

`$ docker build -t evercharge/web:latest .`

Start the container:

`$ docker run -p 9000:9000 --name web evercharge/web`

Get a shell in the container:

`$ docker exec -it web bash`

### Determine dart-sass architecture

Attach a shell to the container and use

`$ dpkg --print-architecture`

to determine your architecture. Download dart-sass for your target Linux architecture from [dart-sass Releases](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases) into the `./dart-sass` directory. Create a folder that matches the architecture name and/or a symlink to the architecture string that will work for your platform.

> Example: `./dart-sass/amd64` is a symlink to `./dart-sass/x64`

### Symlink dart-sass binary

> NOTE: this is done automatically for arm64/x64/amd64 architectures in the Dockerfile.

Unpack binary (Mac Silicon example):

`$ tar -xf dart-sass-1.55.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz`

Symlink sass binary into the container images' path

`$ ln -s /opt/web/dart-sass/$(dpkg --print-architecture)/sass /usr/local/bin/sass`

## Examples

### First Container Start

Add the `-d` flag to run in the background.

```
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name web evercharge/web

-> docker run -p 9000:9000 evercharge/web                                                                                                                                                     [224b37c]

### Restarting a Stopped Container

The `-a` flag will run in the foreground, the default for `docker run`. Omit to run in the background.

```
docker start -a web

-> docker start -a web                                                                                                                                                                             [224b37c]

### Check if a container exists and what is running

```
