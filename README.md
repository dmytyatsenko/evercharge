# Deployment via Pulumi

This repository uses a workflow/action process to deploy via pulumi.

To update or change things:

Create a branch from `master`, typically something like CLOUD-1234/Some Awesome Update.

Make your changes, run them locally (see below), and then push to GitHub.

From there request a merge from your branch into "develop". Once approved the workflow will update the site at [development](https://www.develop.evercharge.com). 

> Note, the blog will always point to the "production" blog as it has its own pipeline.

Confirm your changes and request one of the following workflows:

* If you require QA merge into "staging" which updates the [staging](https://www.staging.evercharge.com) move the ticket to QA.
* If this is a minor change that does *not* require QA (be careful assume it always needs QA) open a PR for "master"

# Run locally

## Quick Note

This container has been switched to Alpine and runs as ARM64 in production now. So there's no need to be concerned with architectures. If you /do/ need to know the architecture:

`uname -m`

Note that arm64 is also aarch64 because thats how the kernel identifies it. 

## Docker Compose Quick Start

> Note: Support for arm64, amd64, and x64 architectures are currently built in. If the output of `dpkg --print-architecture` (in the running container) does not emit one of those three strings, you will need to either symlink your string to an existing binary, or download a new binary. See the Dockerfile and the dart-sass folder for the template.

### First Container Start

Add the `-d` flag to run in the background.

```
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name web evercharge/web

-> docker run -p 9000:9000 evercharge/web                                                                                                                                                     [224b37c]

### Restarting a Stopped Container

The `-a` flag will run in the foreground, the default for `docker run`. Omit to run in the background.

```
docker start -a web

-> docker start -a web                                                                                                                                                                             [224b37c]
