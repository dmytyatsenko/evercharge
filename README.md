# Run locally

## Quick Start

1. Build the container: `docker build -t evercharge/web:latest .`
1. Start the container: `docker run -p 9000:9000 --name web evercharge/web`
1. Get a shell in the container: `docker exec -it web bash`
1. Download dart-sass for your target Linux architecture (use `dpkg --print-architecture` to determine) to web root.
    - arm: `wget https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/download/1.54.7/dart-sass-1.54.7-linux-arm.tar.gz`
    - arm64: `wget https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/download/1.54.7/dart-sass-1.54.7-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
    - x64: `wget https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/download/1.54.7/dart-sass-1.54.7-linux-x64.tar.gz`
    - ia32: `wget https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/download/1.54.7/dart-sass-1.54.7-linux-ia32.tar.gz`
1. Unpack binary: `tar -xf dart-sass-1.54.7-linux-YOURARCH.tar.gz`
1. Symlink sass binary into `$PATH`: `ln -s /opt/web/dart-sass/sass /usr/local/bin/sass`

The image is now ready to run the app: go to http://localhost:9000 in your browser.

TBD: hot reloading with docker compose

### First Container Start

Add the `-d` flag to run in the background.

```
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name web evercharge/web

-> docker run -p 9000:9000 evercharge/web                                                                                                                                                     [224b37c]

### Restarting a Stopped Container

The `-a` flag will run in the foreground, the default for `docker run`. Omit to run in the background.

```
docker start -a web

-> docker start -a web                                                                                                                                                                             [224b37c]

### Check if a container exists and what is running

```
docker ps -a

-> docker ps -a
